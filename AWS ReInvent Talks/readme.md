# AWS ReInvent 2020

Lecture notes from sessions I attended.

## Serverless everything: Replatforming for speed and ownership
Interesting talk about how an e-commerce platform called Dunelm moved to a completely serverless architecture. Datadog pitches their tools for Serverless.

 => Presentation slides + detailed notes are uploaded as a PDF.

### Tradeoffs of switching to Serverless: 
- Where do you begin when debugging? What if multiple services are involved? No servers to look at anymore. 
- If many people deploying at the same time, how to determine who pushed the breaking change?
- How to track deployments over time? Track AWS Lambda versions over time.
- Alerts as code

## Fireside Chat: Women in Leadership

Interview with Indra Nooyi:

- Leading with empathy is a strength when it comes to leadership
- When you hire someone, they come with an entire ecosystem (friends, family, etc.) To help employees bring their entire selves to work, ask them about their families and their lives. Get to know them on a personal level so you can better understand their goals and motivations
- Most important traits in a leader: 
  - life-long learners, 
  - backbone + courage
