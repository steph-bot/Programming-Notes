# Programming Notes

Hi, I'm Stephanie! I work as a software support engineer at a startup in Houston, TX. I started my career as a chemical engineer in process automation design for a major chemical corporation. After a car accident left me seriously injured, I fell in love (again) with web development. I worked through online classes and projects in between doctor's appointments and physical therapy and am now working on becoming the best engineer I can be :-)

I created most these notes to supplement video lectures and tutorials by Andrei Neagoie. It's nice to have a personal reference written in my own words with my own code samples.

Note: Some of the file names say "Javascript" instead of "JavaScript". It seems like renaming the files while maintaining their git histories is a major challenge.
